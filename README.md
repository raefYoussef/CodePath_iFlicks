## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Poster images are loaded using the UIImageView category in the AFNetworking library.
* [x] The movie poster is available by appending the returned poster_path to https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w342.
* [ ] User sees a loading state while waiting for the movies API (you can use any 3rd party library available to do this).
* [ ] User can pull to refresh the movie list.


The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] UI animations
* [x] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.

* [ ] User sees an error message when there's a networking error.
* [ ] Movies are displayed using a CollectionView instead of a TableView.
